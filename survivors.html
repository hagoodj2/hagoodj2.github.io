                    <p>Nicolas, or Nick is one of the four playable Survivors in Left 4 Dead 2. He is a gambler and a con artist with a shady―even violent―past. He seems reluctant to be a part of the group at all and takes the role of "the complainer," finding fault in other people's plans, the increasingly sorry state of his once-fine suit and his teammates' character flaws, as he judges them. This makes him difficult for the others to get along with at first, but that changes as time goes by, as he learns to trust them and proves himself a valuable part of the team.

                <div id="rochelletext">
                    <p>Rochelle plays the role of the "big sister" of the group, and almost everyone treats her with generous respect. Socially, she is also the character who gets the most congenial response from outsiders such as Francis and Whitaker. She is portrayed as sensible, levelheaded, and kind to everybody and as possessing a dry sense of humor that comes out, for example, in relation to the ostensible artistic and performance merits of the Midnight Riders and Jimmy Gibbs Jr.</p>

                <div id="coachtext">
                    <p>Coach is the eldest, voice of reason, and authority of the Left 4 Dead 2 team, playing a similar role to Bill in Left 4 Dead. He comes across as a warm-hearted father figure with an optimistic attitude that is hard to disagree with. Despite his friendly demeanor, his experience as an actual coach makes him demand things of the other Survivors in a positive way - such as loudly encouraging them to get back on their feet and when they are severely hurt, encouraging them to continue rather than giving up. Coach can be seen as the father figure if not the official leader of the group.

                    <p>Ellis (also known as El) is one of the four playable Survivors in Left 4 Dead 2. He is the youngest of the group.

                        A junior mechanic by trade in the city of Savannah, he presents himself as a goofy, beer-loving country guy with an artless and sometimes naive world view.
                        
                        According to Chet, from Valve, he is "extremely excited" about everything, like managing to visit a concert and being able to kill a lot of zombies, occasionally doing both at the same time, like in the Dark Carnival finale.
